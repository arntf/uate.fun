// Base on the attributor,
// ARNTF used Gemini gave a solution as .game-container to fit the game to any screen on any devices, and copilot give me a full script of adding the touches controls of two paddles, and remove the default scrolling feature when you touch the screen. 
// Further plan: add score board, limit the times of challenges, donation option, continue to play.
